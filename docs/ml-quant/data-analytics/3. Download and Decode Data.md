This system is designed to efficiently handle download raw data and decode data
## Overview
Source code: https://github.com/untangledfinance/spark-crawler-decoder

Technical: Spark

Language: Scalar

Features:
- Data Ingestion: Download raw data from RPC services and save it to the data warehouse.
- Data Decoding: Decode raw data into call and event tables according to the provided ABI.
- Contract Information Retrieval: Fetch contract details (e.g., names, symbols, decimals of ERC20 tokens) from RPC services.
- Parallel Processing: Execute jobs on multiple nodes of an AWS EMR cluster for enhanced efficiency.
- Concurrent Data Handling: Download both historical and new data simultaneously.
- Automatic Decoding: Automatically decode data when new ABI information is added.

Execution
- Run by spark-submit on EMR cluster
- Controlled and scheduled by Scheduler: Airflow

## Jobs in this system
Crawler: Job downloads data from RPC Service and stores it in the blocks table (raw transactions and logs data) and block_trace table (raw traces data)

ExtractLog: Extract log data from blocks table and save into logs table

ExtractTransaction: Extract transaction data from blocks table save into transactions table

ExtraceTrace: Extract trace data from block_traces table and save into trace table

DecodeLog: Decode log data in logs table and save into event table. Example: erc20_evt_transfer

DecodeTransaction: Decode trace data in traces table and save into call table. Example: centrifuge_shelf_call_borrow 

GetContractInfo: Using RPC to get information of contract from event or call table and save into info table.

All job of this Application will be managed, scheduled in Airflow
## Example for how to decode new datasets of protocol
Step 1: Determine contract address of protocol
- Using Dune as reference to find contract address

Step 2: From contract address of protocol, determine ABI of this contract
- Using https://etherscan.io/ to get ABI

Step 3: Open CMS, add protocols with ABI

Step 4: Wait a minute and see new datasets in data warehouse
