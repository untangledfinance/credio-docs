2. Raw tables
* The data in these tables is taken directly from the API provided by the RPC service, For each EVM chain we have 4 raw data tables:
    * Block: 
        * Table stores information about blocks of a chain
        * Will be retrieved from the api eth_getblockbynumber, Used the option to get all transactions of the block.
    * Transactions: 
        * Table stores information about transactions
        * Extracted from transaction data in the Block table
    * Traces: 
        * Table stores information about internal transactions. When a transaction is performed, one contract can call a function of another contract and possibly more. Each time, an internal transaction will be created
        * Trace data is taken from trace_block of Quicknode
    * Logs: 
        * Table stores information about logs data. When a transaction is executed, it may emit Logs data to serve tracking depending on the logic code of the contract. 
        * Will be retrieved from the api eth_getlogs

2. Decode tables
* When decoding raw data of protocols, we will get decoded data. Note that in our raw data tables we already have all the raw data of each chain, so for each protocol we only need to use that protocolâ€™s ABI to decode the raw data. There are 2 types of decoded tables:
    * Call: The data in this table is decoded from the Traces table along with the corresponding ABI of the protocols. Each table will contain call data of one Call of many different contracts (if they use the same ABI for that Call).
    * Event: The data in this table is decoded from the Logs table along with the corresponding ABI of the protocols. Each table will contain event data of one Event of many different contracts (if they use the same ABI for that Event).

3. Transform tables
* Tables to serve specific use cases are joined and aggregated from raw and decoded tables, on Dune they are known in the Spellbook project
