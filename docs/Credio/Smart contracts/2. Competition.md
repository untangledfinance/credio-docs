# Competitition contract 
Consumers can use a competition template. For example, in the competition contract, store the following:
- Creation time: Timestamp of the competition contract creation
- Duration: Time until the end of the competition
- Staking amounts: Amount of tokens staked by users in the protocol
- Slash parameters: Conditions under which the consumer is penalized for cheating and how the validator can detect such cheating
- Post-competition parameters: Details for modeler compensation
- Cancellation parameters: Conditions under which the competition creator can cancel (e.g., phrase A, phrase B, phrase C)
- Data return to Credio: Based on template rules, specify whether data is pushed or pulled

## Overview

### ICredio
Interface for managing competitions: Includes methods for validating addresses and closing competitions.

### TransferHelper
Library for safe token transfers: Provides functions for securely transferring tokens.

### BytesLib
Library for byte manipulation: Provides functions for handling and processing byte data.
