# Credio contract (Oracle)

- Consumers can clone a competition contract using a non-upgradeable proxy. There are various contract templates available, provided that they inherit from the ICompetition interface.
- Modelers and validators can interact with competition contracts through Credio contracts.
- For development purposes, an upgradeable proxy (UUPS or Transparent) can be used.
 
## Overview
This contract manages competition instances and provides functionalities for users to create competitions and for owners to register validators, among other features.

Credio allows creators to set up various types of competitions. You can choose to have one or multiple models, use validators or not, and decide whether you or the community selects the winner. Currently, our basic setup involves multiple models and allows validators to choose the best one.

## Events

### CompetitionCreated
Emitted when a competition contract is cloned.

### ValidatorRegistered
Emitted when an address registers as a validator.

### CompetitionClosed
Emitted when a competition is closed, specifying payment details.

### FulfillProof
Emitted when a proof is successfully fulfilled for a competition.

## Errors
Conditions that cause transactions to revert.

### InvalidProof
Reverted when a verification proof fails.

### OnlyCompetition
Reverted when a function can only be called by a competition contract.

### LengthMismatch
Reverted when verifier and batch size arrays have different lengths.

## Functions
Actions that can be performed on the contract.

### initialize
Initializes the contract with vault, Credio token, and validator stake amount.

### cloneCompetition
Creates a new competition contract instance.

### registerAsValidator
Allows an address to register as a validator by staking Credio tokens.

### closeCompetition
Closes a competition by specifying payment details.

### _beforeFulfillProof
Internal function for fee transfer before proof fulfillment.

### fulfillProof
Allows users to submit proofs for verification by a competition.

### _depositERC20ToVault

### _authorizeUpgrade
Restricted function for contract upgrades by the owner ( onlyOwner ).

## View Function
Allows retrieving data from the contract without modifying its state.

### predictCompetitionAddress
